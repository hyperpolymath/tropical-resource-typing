  # Bridge — a resource algebra may measure Echo residues

  ## Boundary invariant (the whole point of this file)

  This module makes one direction precise and machine-checked:

      resource algebra  ──consumed by──▶  residue measure

  A *residue measure* maps an **opaque** residue carrier `E` into a resource
  algebra `R` of this repository, accumulating residues via `R`'s sequential
  composition `⊠`.  The arrow is `E → R`: the residue-measure construction
  *depends on* the resource algebra.

  It is **NOT** the other direction:

      Echo  ──is an instance of──▶  resource / soundness     (FALSE — never)

  * `E` here stands in for an Echo residue carrier.  It is required to be **no
    more than a plain type with a monoid of residues** — it is *not* a
    `ResourceAlgebra`, and nothing here makes it one.  Echo is a modality; it is
    not a resource-grade instance.
  * `R` is a genuine `ResourceAlgebra` (linear, affine, max-plus, min-plus,
    min-max — any instance from `Resource.Instances`).
  * This file imports **no** `echo-types` dependency (the repo has none).  `E` is
    abstract precisely so that an Echo residue interface downstream can supply it
    without this repo ever depending on Echo.

  So: Echo may consume a tropical (or any) resource algebra as a residue measure;
  that does not make Echo a resource instance, nor a soundness instance.

/-- A **residue measure**: an opaque residue carrier `E` (think: Echo residues),
    with a way to combine residues (`combine`) and an empty residue (`empty`),
    measured into a resource algebra `R` so that the measure is a monoid
    homomorphism into `R`'s *sequential-composition* monoid `(⊠, one)`.

    `E` carries **no** `ResourceAlgebra` instance — it is just a type with a
    residue monoid.  Only `R` is a resource algebra.  The dependency direction is
    `E → R`. -/

-- events — NOT a resource algebra).  They are measured into the *max-plus* cost
