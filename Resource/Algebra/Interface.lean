  # Resource Algebra — the consumer-facing interface (algebra layer)

  Author: Jonathan D.A. Jewell (hyperpolymath)
  Verified: Lean 4.13.0 (pinned via `lean-toolchain`), `import Init` (no Mathlib).

  ## What this module is

  This is the **stable, consumer-facing resource-algebra interface** that
  `tropical-resource-typing` exports for downstream languages such as `my-lang`.

  A *resource grade* is a binder/resource quantity: usage, cost, latency,
  critical path, bottleneck, residue measure, etc.  A *resource algebra* is the
  ordered-semiring / usage-algebra interface that resource typing reasons over.
  Concrete *resource instances* — linear `{0,1,ω}`, affine `{0,1,ω}`, max-plus,
  min-plus, min-max — all satisfy this one interface, so a downstream soundness
  proof written against the interface can be instantiated at any of them without
  re-proving algebraic facts.

  ## Design rationale (read before changing)

  * **Operations are bundled as fields**, not via core `Add`/`Mul`/`Zero`/`One`
    typeclasses.  Lean 4.13.0 core ships `Zero` but not `One`, and the existing
    `TropicalSessionTypes.lean` already defines its own local `One` plus a global
    `OfNat _ 1` bridge.  Bundling the ops as fields keeps this interface fully
    self-contained and free of any notation/`One`-instance collision, while
    staying Mathlib-free.
  * The laws here are **only the algebra**: associativity, identities,
    distributivity, and annihilation.  The order, the preorder laws, and
    monotonicity live one layer up in `Resource.Algebra.Ordered`, so a consumer
    that needs only the algebraic skeleton can depend on this module alone.
  * Deliberately **NOT** required: a finite carrier, additive idempotence,
    non-idempotence, multiplicative commutativity, totality, or decidable
    equality.  Tropical instances are idempotent and have infinite carriers;
    `{0,1,ω}` usage instances are non-idempotent and finite; both must fit the
    same interface, so none of those properties may be baked in here.

namespace Resource

/-- A (not necessarily commutative) **resource semiring**: the algebraic core of
    a resource grade.

    Intended reading of the two operations for a resource consumer:

    * `add` (`⊞`)  — combine *alternative* demands / choose between branches.
      In a dioid (tropical) instance this is idempotent; in a `{0,1,ω}` usage
      instance it is not.  The interface assumes neither.
    * `mul` (`⊠`)  — *sequential* composition / accumulation of demands.
      Not assumed commutative: sequential composition need not commute.

    `zero` is the additive identity (and multiplicative annihilator); `one` is
    the multiplicative identity. -/

-- `×` to `Prod`).  Using `⊕`/`⊗` here creates an ambiguous-notation hazard, so
