  # Resource Algebra — the ordered layer

  Author: Jonathan D.A. Jewell (hyperpolymath)
  Verified: Lean 4.13.0 (pinned via `lean-toolchain`), no Mathlib.

  `ResourceAlgebra R` is the full consumer-facing interface: a
  `ResourceSemiring` (algebra core) together with an order `le` (`⊑`) and the
  laws a generic resource-typing soundness proof actually depends on —

  * the order is a **preorder** (reflexive, transitive), the weakest order that
    supports subsumption / subtyping of resource grades;
  * both operations are **monotone** with respect to that order, so refining a
    grade refines every composite that uses it.

  Antisymmetry is *not* part of the core (a preorder is enough for subsumption);
  instances that have it expose the optional `PartialOrderedResourceAlgebra`
  refinement below.  No instance is forced to be a partial order, total, or
  decidable.

  ## Order direction (a per-instance convention, documented at each instance)

  The interface fixes the *laws* of `⊑`, not its *meaning*.  Each concrete
  instance documents which direction of `a ⊑ b` means "better", "worse",
  "less costly", or "more available" for that algebra (see `Resource.Instances.*`).

    this; consumers that need it can require this stronger interface, but the
