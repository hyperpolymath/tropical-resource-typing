  # Transport Semilattice — Tropical Connection (v1.0)

  Author: Jonathan D.A. Jewell (hyperpolymath)
  Date:   2026-04-11

  ## The claim being formalised

  Protocol Squisher's 4-class transport semilattice
  (Concorde / Business / Economy / Wheelbarrow) is formally a **tropical
  optimisation problem**: adapter path search is Dijkstra over a tropical
  (idempotent) semiring.

  This file makes that claim precise.

  ## Structure of this file

  1. `TransportGrade` — an Nat embedding for the 4 classes (0=best)
  2. `TransportSemilattice` — the join semilattice (max=worst of two classes)
  3. `PathCost` — the grade of a composed adapter path (bottleneck = max of steps)
  4. The **path optimisation semiring**: ⊕ = min, ⊗ = max
     This is the "min-max" or "bottleneck" semiring — a tropical semiring
     dual to the max-plus semiring used in `TropicalSessionTypes.lean`.
  5. `semiring_laws_*` — the 8 semiring axioms verified for this structure
  6. `OptimalPath` — the minimax path theorem: optimal = min over paths of max(grades)
  7. `TropicalDuality` — the relationship between min-max and max-plus tropical semirings

  ## Relationship to TropicalSessionTypes.lean

  `TropicalSessionTypes.lean` (in `tropical-resource-typing`) proves a
  max-plus CommSemiring instance where ⊕=max and ⊗=+.  The transport path
  semiring here has ⊕=min and ⊗=max.  Both are **dioids** (semirings with
  idempotent addition):
  - max-plus:  max is idempotent (max(n,n)=n)
  - min-max:   min is idempotent (min(n,n)=n)

  The formal duality: grade_path(P) in the min-max semiring corresponds to
  the grade_session(S) QTT refinement in the max-plus semiring via the map
  g ↦ (maxGrade − g), which is an order-reversing isomorphism on the
  bounded lattice [0, maxGrade].

  ## Open items (no sorry here — these are documented future work)

  1. ~~Prove the Dijkstra correctness theorem for min-max semirings~~ **DONE**:
     `foldl_tcAdd_le_init` + `foldl_tcAdd_le_mem` + `minimax_path_optimal`
     prove the optimal-path property for the foldl-min formulation.
     Full graph-algorithmic Dijkstra correctness (generalised to arbitrary graphs)
     remains future work; the classical result is Mohri 2002.
  2. Formalise the order-reversing isomorphism explicitly as a semiring
     homomorphism (not just stated in comments).
  3. Connect to `TropicalSessionTypes.lean` CommSemiring instance directly
     by constructing a functor between the two structures in Lean.

/-- `dualGrade` is an order-reversing **lattice anti-isomorphism** on `[0, maxGrade]`.
    It therefore exchanges the two idempotent operations by De Morgan:

    * `dual (min a b) = max (dual a) (dual b)`   (`dual_tcAdd_is_max`)
    * `dual (max a b) = min (dual a) (dual b)`   (`dual_tcMul_is_min`)

    This is the precise, *provable* connection between the min-max transport
    semiring here (⊕=min, ⊗=max) and the max-plus semiring in
    `TropicalSessionTypes.lean` (⊕=max, ⊗=+).

    It is NOT a semiring homomorphism from (min,max) to (max,+).  The previous
    `dual_tcMul_bounded` claimed `dual (max m n) = dual m + dual n - maxGrade`,
    which is **false**: for `m = 1, n = 2` the LHS is `dual 2 = 1` but the RHS is

-- 7.  Hub ceiling — the no-go corollary
-- ============================================================================

/-- **Hub ceiling** — corollary of `pathCost_mono`.

    Any adapter path that routes through an edge `e` (a transport step of
    grade `g = grade e`) has `pathCost` at least `g`.  The bottleneck of a
    whole path is floored by every individual step it contains.

    Read as a no-go result for universal, high-fidelity interoperability:
    if every conversion is forced through a single common hub, and the hub's
    best embedding of some format is graded `g`, then no path through that
    hub can carry that format at fidelity better than `g`.  One hub therefore
    caps the fidelity of every format that must pass through it.  "Universal"
    (one hub serving all formats) and "high fidelity" (grade 0 for all
    formats) are contradictory the moment any format embeds into the hub at
    grade > 0.  Universal *low* fidelity is the achievable point — that is
    what JSON already is.

    This corollary was never stated during the v1.x development.  It closes
    Protocol Squisher's universal-interoperability claim using the project's
    own algebra: transport-class composition is `max` (the bottleneck), and
    `max` over a path can only be raised, never lowered, by the steps in it. -/
